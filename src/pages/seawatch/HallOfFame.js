	    <Heading> Five Hawaiian Petrels </Heading>

	        An amazing week of unprecedented Hawaiian Petrel sightings culminated in five birds in one hour, plus a Manx shearwater.

	    <Body>
	        First at 5:14 p.m., about 5:30 p.m. (two in sight simultaneously), 5:58 p.m, 6:03 p.m. All birds were well beyond the kelpline and were first spotted deep inside the bay.
	        Most of the birds were low-arcing with fairly direct flight (though still distinctive as petrels with crooked wings and tightly controlled pivots).
	        One bird was more prone to circling back, but all were exiting the bay. At one point, we realized two were simultaneously in view.
	        The first bird had passed fifteen minutes earlier, so we theorized that there were at least three birds. Later, two additional birds were seen.
	        It's possible the earlier birds had circled back, but given how deep inside the bay each was initially seen and how directly each exited the bay, we felt that there were five individual birds.
	        Each bird was identifiable as a petrel due to its flight pattern as aforementioned. Additionally, each bird also showed the blinding white forehead and gleaming white underwings.
	        Backlit birds appeared black on top, but were gray in direct light. Some birds were close enough to pick out the black ulnar bar on the underwing.

			I idly scanned the sand immediately below the seawatch during a lull and spotted what looked like a pipit with a long tail on the wrack.
			It had a faint yellow wash to the face. Bill Hubick immediately noticed me looking as the bird took off right in front of us.
			Bill recognized it as "a $#%& wagtail" and got everyone on it. I got some photos of it flying away, and it called.
			It sounded like an American pipit - two quick series of 3 repeated notes - but with a more strident quality.
			It flew east over the water close to shore out of sight. All in all we saw this bird for probably less than 30 seconds.
