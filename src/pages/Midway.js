	<Heading> Introduction </Heading>
	<Body>
	In the winter of 2024 I was fortunate enough to participate as a volunteer counter for the annual albatross census on Midway Atoll. The following is an account of my 6-week experience on the largest albatross colony on Earth.

	The crew didn't fill the jet with enough fuel, so we're waiting on that... Only a few minutes behind, which by Midway (or remote island) standards is apparently pretty good. Beth Flint picked us up in her car and drove like a demon to the FWS bunkhouse. We picked up a van and two biologists who are conducting a drone survey. Beth was very nice and bought us all dinner and told some funny stories (like how the Idaho FWS staff sent a bunch of office furniture + TVs to Honolulu but forgot to the lash them down for the container ship). 10 on board: pilot, co-pilot, Zhao (sp.?)  - Midway staff, Anna + Dan - biologists, and volunteers: me, Ken, Simone, Lauren, Ashley. The jet we're on is fancy but small - like that of a low-tier CEO. Buttons don't work. As we were waiting for our luggage to be packed, a PAGP flew in over our heads giving a piercing call and landed in the parking lot.

	1 hour to go... Moon is higher. Shining white, but reflecting orange off the ocean. Water looks very calm.. infinite expanse of silver sheet. haze at the horizon - a few bright stars.

	<Body>
	After landing:
	</Body>
	<Body>
	Feels like a fever dream. First the descent - plane pointed down after sharp bank. Runway lights out of nowhere. albatross like rows of tombstones off runway. Got off the plane - BOPE overhead like bats glowing in moonlight. Whinnying of LAAL. Bill clacks. Golf cart through the colony to Charlie barracks. Welcome from staff and counters.
	</Body>
	<Body>
	Meet at 6:20 in lobby with headlamps.

	Sunrise is much later than I thought. It's 7:45AM now and light out, but the sun isn't up yet. We met at 6:20 + walked to the Clipper House. BOPE overhead in the dark.
	Delicious breakfast and chats about wild boars at Kilauea. Granted leisure time til 8:15 - we (the newbies) slowly walked back to the barracks.
	On the way 2BFAL, 2BTCU, BRNO, BLNO, 1LADU, PAGP, WHTE, BOPE, WECE. There is a boardwalk over the dunes leading to the Clipper House, and the LAAL were using it as a runway.
	Very clumsy w/ many crash landings. Moli displaying, allopreening, stretching wings. I almost want to cry - the sheer exuberance of life is overwhelming. Gives hope.
	Bikes have been assigned - fixies. Just saw a moli trip over a BOPE burrow - glad to know even the locals do it.

	Sitting at Captain Brooks lanai. Heard wolf whistle - BTCU. Tried 'ulu for the first time - delicious. Steamed (?) w/ coconut sauce. Today was our first count. The leaders had us do a practice count - sight count followed by dot count, where the dot count is the source of truth. 131, 87 -> 133, 91. Leaders were happy w/ the !1% error rate on LAAL but wanted more practice w/ the 4% BFAL error. We aim for 2-3% error rate. We were at Sector 48 where the STALs are. Returning after lunch.

	The extreme happiness is hard to contain. Walking on the most beautiful beach. Stopped by monk seal. BTCU photo session - heard something walk past - moli. Sky rose pink, water aqua, white sand. bliss

	It's late and I should sleep. A lot happened today so let's go through it quick - first full day of counting - sector 48. We started with a practice round w/ dot verification.
	We performed satisfactorily so we continued w/ the normal count. Bob + Caren (leaders) have a hilarious worried mom/ effusive dad dynamic.
	Working near Bob is good for the ego  - lots of praise. Constant criticism (constructive) from Caren. I decided to stick to Caren as much as possible - gratified to hear fewer comments.
	Compliments at the end. As a reward ( we really got much more comfortable) - they showed us the STAL nest. Geraldine + 1 juv. nearby. Jon gave talk in evening.
	We chatted about Brian Sullivan - "Sully" - old roommates (Jon was his boss) on San Clemente island. GTTA tip: check brackish seep SE side! Time for a quick shower - so sweaty.

	It's very windy - not a storm. Bit nervous about today's count. Slightly toasted by sun from yday even through buff.
	Still figuring appropriate amount of food to eat - a little over-full today.

	Another day packed full of interesting things - gov shutdown announced yesterday was possibly going to make us work on Sunday, but just heard it was resolved.
	Today we worked on sectors 39 - Parade Grounds - and 29 - inner harbor. Both had a bit of interesting terrain to spice things up - ironwoods and concrete walls + buildings, respectively.
	</Body>
	
	<Body>
	Today we witnessed "the green wall." A rainstorm came in quick right at the end of the count. Morgan (FWS?) told us that Midway is called Kuaihelani - "backbone of the sky" - referring
	to its remote position in Po - land of ancestors - but also to a physical phenomenon: low clouds glow blue-green as they reflect the lagoon water. So amazing...
	</Body>
	
	<Body>
	Before dinner I checked out the water catchment area - LBDO, NOPI, NSHO, BUFF, GWTE, EUWI, AMWI, and GTTA! No WOSA, SCAUP, TUDU...
	After dinner I was invited to Brooks by Chris and Po when they saw me seawatching outside. Chris is a real character - super nice.
	Elaine also said let's talk about getting me a permanent position. They are being so nice - wonder why? Chris said she can tell a real bird lover when she sees one.
	I wonder what Elaine sees in me since we've barely met. Maybe just excited about having new faces around.

	Caren showed us the "Trispies" (TRSP). Sound like CAQU or "Mickey Mouse chuckling." Flew right over our heads - ~10 birds. Four days in?
	Feels like a month - only just found the bathroom light switch...

	<Body>
	We did sector 3 - first bit of real tricky terrain. Naupaka mazes + ironwood/hau trees. Plus real sandy burrow-ridden hills. We did super well though!!
	First covered the flat - after lunch we did the tricky bits. Dot counting in the mazes was very satisfying - like dungeon crawling - marking off your path with lines.
	</Body>
	
	<H3> 1700 </H3>
	<Body>
	We checked out the catchment before and after the afternoon count. WI/CO SNIPE, LESC. Another BUFF + NSHO. WOSA made an appearance at the end of the day. Raining the whole time - worth it.

	Spent all day birding - exhausted. Pre-dawn for Trispies @ "Ave Maria" (the old church) - nothing.  Moonlit - yesterday cloudy + dark. Maybe they don't come out if it's not dark enough
	Then off to Brackish Seep (SE side of the island). Saw GTTA + WISN. Brunch, then Catchment Basin - COSN (!!!), WOSA, TUDU, GWFG. Nikki gave us a tour and showed us "Phoebo" the STAL of the NW forest.
	Got awesome yawn photos. Ended at Cargo Pier where the honu were hauled out, + BRBO + RFBO + WATA. Beautiful weather on our day off, though forecast for the week looks rough.
	Forgot to mention Radar Hill Seep before Cargo Pier - so many LADU! + lots of duck drama. After dinner - walk on North Beach. Monk seal + cool spherical/oblong sand dollar tests.
	Cookie decorating at Cap. Brooks was festive - eggnog and Elaine's homemade Irish Cream (tasted like Bailey's w/ coconut). I keep forgetting the times, so here's the weekly schedule.

	Another packed day. Wasn't very hungry in the morning - delighted to find congee. We counted sectors 12 + 16 - funny b/c we were just there yesterday (Radar Hill).
	Bob was very happy with me (we did some naupaka "strike teams") + said I have a natural affinity for it. I was clearing out a burrow I had just collapsed when he said that,
	so I asked - counting or collapsing? "Not mutually exclusive."

	Got back from the office (wifi). Linda has been at the vet ER with Goose for the last 3-4 hours for dizziness. Finally heard back that it's an inner ear infection. I feel relieved for now.
	While I was waiting 4 cockroaches crawled on my legs. On the way back I saw my first centiped - seemed a foot long but was probably more like 8in. Also a ~4in black slug.
	I also stopped at the generators to see the BOPE "dance party" (per Anna the biologist). Apparently they like the vibes, so there are just BOPEs everywhere around the generators.

	Today we worked on Sector 4 - a monster. The leaders divided it into 3, so we did 4B. The other team did one yesterday, and the third part today. It was tough and we didn't finish,
	but we covered a LOT! I stopped at Frigate Roost on my way home since it was close by. We were worried about the paint lasting until the 26th, and Caren liked my suggestion of using
	a Gaia track as a safety measure.

	Sector 4 is finally done! We moved onto 6 and thought we could finish it but we got monked - several monk seals were parked right on the beach preventing us from completing the count.
	We got the rest done though. We were taking numbers when something happened that I don't think I'll ever forget. We were standing in a circle, and Simone was drinking water when she started choking.
	She was pointing and trying to say something. When she finally caught her breath she said "Phoebo!" He was right behind us! He lumbered past us back over to his usual spot. We then realized that he
	just landed on the beach and walked in through the naupaka. We went over and found his enormous footprints. Amazing! Tomorrow we are headed to Eastern Island. Seems like the entire island is heading over.
	We packed sandwiches at Clipper after dinner. PB+J and roast beef (2 sandwiches, not one...).

	Very long day as predicted. We finished Sector 8 on Eastern and got most of 9 done with just a sliver left. Hopefully we can go back on Sunday to bird. Saw a MABO chick all on its own.
	One hybrid albatross. One GRFR w/ armpit tabs, plus a young bird in a naupaka. Tried some pickleweed leaves on Caren's suggestion - surprisingly delicious (and salty). The front of the boat
	we took folds out for wet landings - fun. An old sentry gun greeted us at the dock. Also found the WTTR chick Nikki told us about (in a tree cavity near her house).

	Another incredibly full day. Very tired. Ken + Bob finished up Sector 6 while the rest of us did 5 - through the ironwoods. Very long and slow passes. I drew the lines - felt good about paint use
	as the leaders are worried about running out. Pam did our swim + snorkel test (as former refuge manager). Then we snorkeled! So cool! Really hit home that we are way out in the Pacific. Needlefish, lobster,
	imperial nudibranch - blue, yellow, white, some sort of Toby. Capped it all off with some dives off Cargo Pier. Water gets very deep very quickly. CBC tomorrow!

	Forgot to mention we checked out the BOPE dance party last night. There were perhaps 3x as many as last time. Two flew at my headlamp and landed on me - one perched on my shoulder for a few minutes.
	So cute. Today was CBC day. As was previously hinted, I was assigned catchment by Jon. Lisa and I were successful in photographing the COSN! Lisa walked around while I sat with the sun at my back with camera ready.
	We then walked out to Frigate Point with Jon, Nikki, Ken. Beautiful "albatross highway" - constant stream along the beach. We then went to Eastern Island after brunch. Dan + Anna saw a first-cycle gull
	at the spit on Friday so that was on everyone's minds. We saw a pair of RTTRs displaying (also a pair selecting a nest site right outside Clipper House during lunch!). We saw a flock of Sanderlings - Hunakai - fly by
	the beach. On our way to the seep, we startled a Pueo! SEOW was in the naupaka. Flew off and movved by WHTE. Such a cool find! Saw some BRBO imms. being fed, a MABO chick, RFBO (dark morphs). Lots of GRFRs.
	Later we heard that the gull was seen on North Beach Sand island...

	Everyone was grouchy today, maybe mostly me. We were supposed to go to Eastern and just as we were loading our bags onto the boat we were told the counters are going tomorrow instead. Not sure why. We counted Sector 7
	and a bit of 50. 7 was full of deep burrows = we set a record for crashes. We ate lunch on the beach since we were all packed for Eastern. Very relaxing - and we needed it. Simone found a RTRT chick - Jon said they're
	the only species that nests in Naupaka; WTTR are basically reliant on the ironwoods here.

	Very long day on Eastern. The leaders moved Ken onto the other team and I think everyone on our team was happier for it. He's difficult to work with - don't want to add much more than that. We finishedoff the sliver of
	Sector 9 (ended up taking an hour - larger than expected). We then worked on Sector 2. We tackled it along with the other team from opposite sides. I was drawing the line when we met. We decided to make a mega-team to
	finish it off. We ended up in a tricky situation where we were following two lines I drew. The lines were pretty squirrelly and people got really foncused. Luckily I had the big picture in my head and tried to stay confident
	- and it worked out. Everyone congratulated me for keeping things under control. Greg said I make a natural count leader.

	Also, we saw a gull on Eastern! Notably this was not the same gull spotted by Anna on Friday (which had a dark bill - this one had a bicolored bill). Hopefully we can identify it. I also spotted a pair of BBPL in a flock of
	PAGP. Pretty funny since it's the opposite of what I usually look for in California.
