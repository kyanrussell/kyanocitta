<p>The crew didn't fill the jet with enough fuel, so we're waiting on that... Only a few minutes behind, which by Midway (or remote island) standards is apparently pretty good. Beth Flint picked us up in her car and drove like a demon to the FWS bunkhouse. We picked up a van and two biologists who are conducting a drone survey. Beth was very nice and bought us all dinner and told some funny stories (like how the Idaho FWS staff sent a bunch of office furniture + TVs to Honolulu but forgot to the lash them down for the container ship). 10 on board: pilot, co-pilot, Zhao (sp.?)  - Midway staff, Anna + Dan - biologists, and volunteers: me, Ken, Simone, Lauren, Ashley. The jet we're on is fancy but small - like that of a low-tier CEO. Buttons don't work. As we were waiting for our luggage to be packed, a PAGP flew in over our heads giving a piercing call and landed in the parking lot. </p>

<p>Moonrise behind us</p>
	<p>waning gibbous</p>
		<p>burnt orange under clouds</p>

<p>1 hour to go... Moon is higher. Shining white, but reflecting orange off the ocean. Water looks very calm.. infinite expanse of silver sheet. haze at the horizon - a few bright stars.</p>

<p>After landing:</p>
<p>Feels like a fever dream. First the descent - plane pointed down after sharp bank. Runway lights out of nowhere. albatross like rows of tombstones off runway. Got off the plane - BOPE overhead like bats glowing in moonlight. Whinnying of LAAL. Bill clacks. Golf cart through the colony to Charlie barracks. Welcome from staff and counters.</p>

<p>Meet at 6:20 in lobby with headlamps.</p>
